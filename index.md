<!-- Tiago received his BSc in Computer Science ($2010$-$2014$) from University of São Paulo, Brazil. While in undergraduate school he worked in two research projects, both under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Moacir Ponti. 
%During the first project, from $2011$ to $2012$, he worked with detecting hand-raising gestures in a distance learning environment. During the second project, from $2012$ to $2013$, he studied the use of ensembles of OPF (Optimum-Path Forest) classifiers with unbalanced datasets. 
From September of $2013$ to February of $2014$ he was in an internship at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP), Portugal. In $2014$, he started taking classes at graduate school as a special student. 
%After graduating, he was accepted in both MSc and PhD programs at University of São Paulo and, in March of $2015$, 
Since $2015$, he has been working towards his Ph.D. in Computer Science and Computational Mathematics, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Moacir Ponti. His Ph.D. project focus on detecting anomalies in surveillance videos. From June to November of $2016$ he was a Ph.D. exchange student at Sapienza University of Rome, Italy, working with Prof. Dr. Barbara Caputo. On May $2017$, he started working at Itaú-Unibanco as a Data Scientist. His main research interests are: pattern recognition, computer vision and deep learning. -->
